![[traditional data center.JPG]]

- It is a centralised system from where all the computing operations take place
- Within a office a dedicated space for the data center - servers are placed , it team maintaining it
- **Limitation of data centers** 
   - **dedicated data center** - within organisation - lot of space - 100's of servers - placed in racks 
   - **huge costing / capex** - lot of capital expenditure - server setups -racks - networking cables - storage devices - servers are very costly , because it requires ample of servers, routers, hubs, switches etc - huge IT team working to maintain the servers
   - **provisioning** - making server ready for production environment/ server ready for making your app up and ready - it is time consuming - 
   - **utilization** - servers might be under utilised - not cost efficient - if servers utilised more than it's capacity - it could lead to over utilisation of resources - lead to business loss - lead to server collapse
   - **on-spot demands** - 
   - **capacity planning** - it is difficult when we are working under the traditional data center the system

# Cloud infrastructure
- ***universal*** - we can setup our remote cloud servers anywhere in the world
- ***on spot demands*** - 
- ***costing/ capex*** - you only pay for what you use 
- ***Rapid provisioning*** - in less than 2 minutes you can lauch server
- ***Increased utilization*** - servers are used efficiently - dynamic servers positioning  
- ***shared pools*** - multiple organisations can use the same cloud servers multiple times
