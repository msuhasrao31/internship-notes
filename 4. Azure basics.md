# Azure concepts

- It is different in sense with GUI and naming rest everything is same 
- more than 200 services

- virtual machines , vnet servers, dock storage
- inside every domain they are segregated into several domains
- you cannot create your own service - any custom services is not allowed
- a **resource group** is needed - it is container to keep a record which tells about all the services used in the azure
- **subscription** - pay as you go
- resource ground need to be created to use azure services
- resource group helps to find the resources running - to get associated to azure services
- virtual machines are mimic to local machine - ec2-aws,google compute engine- gcp , vm - azure 


- all services -> all categories -> compute -> virtual machine 


- **create a virtual machine** - create -> select subscription -> resource group -> os image - windows 22 , cpu and select the required details -> review and create 
  creation of virtual machine is done

remote desktop start enter your details and enter to the virtual desktop


#### accidental deletion of servers

- we use locks in order to protect the deletion of the servers
- rdp - for windows servers
#### using cmd in windows
- ssh - for linux
- ssh username@publicipaddress
- ssh suhas-linux@20.102.70.15

#### using putty
- enter ip address, then username and password


# Assignment 1

1. Under which service offering type, cloud service provider is responsible for managing OS while cloud consumer is responsible for managing applications?

answer: **platform as a service**

2. To create highly available environment in azure, we deploy service across

answer: **availability zones** - highly available zones - 2 factors - high availability and destruction recoverability - you should have backup 

- servers get created on some one data centers is called as cloud computing 
- concept of AZ is used az- availability zones to choose the specific zone in the world
- we create our servers on availability zone - minimum count is 3 same for gcp for aws -2

3.  what type of servers used for data bases
- **memory optimised**

4. can we have multiple vnet's in a single region
- **true** - visit the virtual network , it is multiple vnets at east us

5. which component in azure eco system is used to restrict traffic
- **network security group NSG**


# Storage accounts
resource group -> storage -> container -> public/private/blob storage
