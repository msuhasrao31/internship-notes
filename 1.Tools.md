# Create a project

1. click on create project and create blank project
2. project name  and initialise starting details
3. copy of the project - clone
4. for cloning ssh is preferable - for that we need to create a ssh key
5. steps for git initialisation
1 git config --global user.email "suhas.msr@gmail.com"
2 git config --global user.name "Suhas Rao Mogiligidda"
touch filename
cd location
3 add .gitignore file by filename/ , which are not required
4 git init
5 git add . - all content push to staging step in github
6 git commit -m "message" 
7 git status
8 git remote add origin git@github.com:msuhasrao31/internship-notes.git
9 git push origin master
10 ssh keys setup - ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ssh file location and copy ssh
11 git push origin master

- Whenever you initiate the first commit then the master branch gets created automatically
- ``` git push <remote repository name> <branch name>
-  ```git remote -v```
-  ```git push origin master```
-  after cloning we don't have to clone again after the addition/ deletion of the files so we use the following command:  ```git pull <url>```
